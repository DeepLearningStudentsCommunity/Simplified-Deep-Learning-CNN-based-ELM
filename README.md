In this research proposed another popular method used for rainfall prediction is Deep Learning (DL) which is part of Neural Network (NN). However existing DL with backpropagation (BP) has a very high time of computing, so it is necessary to use another technique that can accelerate the learning speed DL without BP. Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) has a simpler structure, as well as non-linear approach capability and better convergence speed than BP. So itâ€™s suitable for use in Deep Learning (Pang, S. and Yang, X., 2016). The result of combining this method gives better performance than the conventional Deep Learning method. Therefore, in this research proposed method of Simplified Deep Learning-Based Extreme Learning Machine for rainfall prediction in Malang Regency in hopes can give more accurate rainfall result.
